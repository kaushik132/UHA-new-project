We want to emphasize that there are only certain situations when we can offer a full refund. These are:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="policy_box mt-4">
              <h4>No Delivery / Partial Delivery / Cancellation by Customer</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>No tutor assigned yet: This is a rare situation, but sometimes it happens. The amount of the refund is always 100%. If such a situation does occur, the customer should not worry since they will be notified as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>The tutor was confirmed, and less than half of the deadline has passed but you decided to cancel the order. In this case, the refund amount varies from 100% to 75%, to cover the effort of the company and the tutor in their attempt to provide you with the product and services purchased.</li>
                <li>The tutor was confirmed, and over half of the remaining deadline has passed, but the customer decided to cancel the order. The amount of refund can vary between 50%-0% to cover the tutor's and company's efforts to accommodate your order request.</li>
                <li>Late Delivery: It can only happen if the tutor gets ill or in case of other emergencies. Customer reserves the right to request a refund in case of delays ONLY if the customer has NOT downloaded the work submitted by the tutor. In case the work delivered by the tutor has been downloaded, the customer is ineligible for a refund and is deemed to have used it.</li>
                <li>On-time delivery of all the orders is guaranteed. Sometimes delays can happen due to the needed materials being uploaded too late by the customer. In this situation, no refund can be granted. That is why it is always ideal to send all information regarding the task, including any additional sources that must be used all at once when placing the order initially.</li>
              </ol>

              <ul>
                <li>Disputed claims: If the customer is not satisfied with the quality and specifications of the work and would like to get a refund instead, the company would be obliged to take the concerns into consideration and rectify the issues. Based on the plan opted for, the customer can request correction till 30/45/60 days for Limited/Standard/Premium plan, respectively, from first submission date. In case the customer is still not satisfied, the customer has a right to request a refund by providing relevant evidence/documentary proof within 7 days of receiving the work. The refund claim will be approved or denied based on the result of the investigation which is highly dependent on the facts of the case and documentary evidence provided by the customer.</li>
                <li>Plagiarized content: If there is a claim that the work produced by the tutor is plagiarized, a third-party verifiable report should be provided by the customer needed within 72 hours of receiving the said work. In case the claim is substantiated, a full refund will be issued to the customer.</li>
